## üîÑ Loop until Task Completion

Following the MirrorStack ERP core architecture, this project will implement the "Loop until ‰ªªÂãôÂÆåÊàê" (Loop until task completion) approach:

1. **Break down complex tasks** into manageable steps
2. **Implement permission checks** and risk assessment for each step
3. **Provide error handling** and alternative solutions
4. **Monitor real-time progress** and provide feedback
5. **Continue looping** until 100% task completion

This approach distinguishes MirrorStack from traditional single-operation AI assistants and provides our core competitive advantage.
